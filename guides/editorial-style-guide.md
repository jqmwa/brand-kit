## About Mental Wealth Academy
Mental Wealth Academy is a research-driven educational organization focused on improving cyber-psychology, and pragmatic governance systems using technology.

We expose how enframent and pattern-recognition maladaptively shape biased behavior, belief, and power. We build agentic decentralized systems of the future.

## Critical Style Conventions
- Always refer to Mental Wealth Academy as Mental Wealth Academy, it should only be abbreviated after being established full once.
- Use the term Blockchain Account instead of wallet, avoid financially stressful language.
- Use technical terms sparingly, and when you do, work to explain them in full
- Use readable language and grammar.
- Have your post explain the relevance and significance to Base Network and its mission.

## What to Avoid
The Mental Wealth Academy core team does its best to support partners who positively contribute to the MWA ecosystem. To increase your chances of partnership on social channels, please avoid the following (including in any linked content):
- **Using Financial Terminology:** Refrain from financial terms indicating gains, profits, investments, high yields, leverage, lucrative opportunities, etc. Avoid providing investment recommendations, calls to action, or strategies.
- **Mentioning Specific Tokens:** Focus on your utility, gameplay, or experience instead of singling out specific tokens, token rewards, etc. This applies to both written content and product visuals (e.g., screenshots or videos).
- **No Context of Underlying Project:** This might be the first time someone in the Base ecosystem is learning about your project. Avoid solely focusing on specific products, isolated milestones, or new features, without readers understanding the context of your underlying project.
- **Disputable Superlatives:** Avoid using unverified superlatives like “the best”, “the first”, “maximize”, “ensure”, etc.
- **Unapproved Partnerships:** Avoid references to a “partnership” or “collaboration” with Base and instead reference that your project is launched on, built on, or integrated with Base.
- **Overly Aggressive Marketing:** Avoid aggressive marketing tactics (e.g., overuse all caps, overuse of emojis, etc.), promotions, and discounts, as they may send the wrong message within the Base ecosystem.
- **False or Misleading Information:** Ensure all information shared is accurate, truthful, and does not mislead readers.
- **Unsupported Data:** Share the source of any data presented.
- **Focuses on Coinbase instead of Base:** Base is an open, permissionless Ethereum L2 incubated at Coinbase with a commitment to decentralization. Focus on Base itself, rather than an exaggerated nexus to Coinbase.
- **Negative Comparisons:** Refrain from putting down other projects or competitors.
- **NSFW Content:** Refrain from using offensive, NSFW, explicit language or content in any communication, including your website.
- **Unreleased Products:** Avoid teasers of products that are unavailable for immediate use.
- **Incomplete Posts:** Include all content (i.e., videos, images, linked content, etc.) in your submitted post.
- **Unlicensed IP:** Remove any IP in your post and website that is not properly licensed.
- **Non-Compliant Terms:** Do not promote applications that transfer value without terms of service/use that include compliance with applicable laws, including sanctions laws.
- **No Geofencing (in Certain Cases):** Certain applications may be subject to US geofencing requirements and a clear indication in the beginning of your post that the application is only available to non-US users in order to be eligible for amplification at our sole discretion.
- **No KYC (in Certain Cases):** Certain applications may be subject to KYC obligations and a clear indication in the beginning of your post that the application is only available to KYC’d/qualified users in order to be eligible for amplification at our sole discretion.


## Writing Guidelines

**Emphasize Mental Wealth Academy's visual and mission**

Mental Wealth Academy has a pragmatic vision to improving governance systems in low-income areas and a mission to complete this by using blockchain as a governance tool alongside agentic ai agents, to increase a world that values empathy, excellence, and education. Highlight how MWA aims to make this decentralized future more accessible for everyone, everywhere.

Highlight progress and what's next

When discussing Mental Wealth Academy's ongoing developments, celebrate recent milestones and accomplishments. Outline the priorities and initiatives planned for the current or upcoming period, grounding them in Mental Wealth Academy's overarching vision and mission. Invite collaboration from the community, fostering an environment where external perspectives can contribute ideas and feedback.

**Focus on concrete examples over abstract concepts**

Avoid excessive abstract language about "DAOs" or technical language around “blockchains,” etc. Ground writing in concrete examples of what Mental Wealth Academy enables: Learning Management Systems for the Future of Learning, Platform governance that gives power rewards and agency to it's users, seamless onboarding and personified ecosystem.

**Use clear examples to illustrate concepts**

While some technical depth is unavoidable, aim to make abstract onchain concepts accessible through clear examples and analogies. Compare new paradigms to familiar ones to build understanding. Use specifics and walk through sample user flows to demonstrate core value propositions.

**Whenever possible, celebrate builders**

Mental Wealth Academy exists to empower those seeking to become educators, and teaching can be defined with a wide net: Workshops, campfire chats, competitions, quests, etc. Frequently highlight and celebrate the projects, people, and communities utilizing MWA's platform.

**Be a bridge**

Assume your audience includes governance and philosophy newcomers. Use analogies and examples to make clear connections on how decisions are made and argued effectively.

## Tone and Voice

”Although tone and voice are often used together, they are not at all the same thing. Voice is the overall personality of your brand and can be described in adjectives like helpful, witty, or friendly. […] your brand’s voice will not change. However, tone, or tone of voice, is the attitude of your writing for a particular content piece.” - Shelby Crawford

If an idea cannot be explained plainly, it is not yet understood well enough to publish.

Precision beats volume.
Arguments matter more than adjectives.
Mechanisms matter more than metaphors—though metaphors may be used to clarify mechanisms.

We prefer explanation over persuasion.
Diagnosis over outrage.
Insight over performance.

## Grammar and Formatting Standards

Use standard American English.

Favor active voice.
Prefer concrete verbs over abstract constructions.
Avoid filler phrases that signal authority without substance.

Paragraphs should be short and intentional. Dense blocks are acceptable only when the conceptual load demands it.

Headings should describe the function of the section, not tease or exaggerate.

Lists may be used for clarity, but never to replace reasoning.

## Inclusive Language

Mental Wealth Academy uses inclusive language by default.

Avoid language that assumes a single cultural background, economic status, or cognitive norm.

Do not frame intelligence, productivity, or success as moral traits.

Avoid pathologizing language when discussing behavior, attention, motivation, or belief. Describe conditions and systems, not personal failure.

When discussing social groups or power dynamics, be precise and grounded. Avoid slogans and generalizations.

## Content Structure

Most longform pieces should follow a discernible intellectual arc:

Establish the system or problem being examined.

Identify how framing, incentives, or context distort perception.

Analyze consequences across education, governance, culture, or psychology.

Offer reframing, design principles, or pathways forward.

Not every piece needs solutions—but every piece must increase understanding.

## Visuals and Design Integration

Visuals are not decoration. They are explanatory tools.

Use diagrams, charts, or illustrations only when they add clarity.

Avoid stock imagery, motivational visuals, or aesthetic filler.

Typography and layout should support slow reading and careful thought.

White space is not wasted space.

## Review Standard (Example Calibration)

A strong Mental Wealth Academy article does not merely summarize ideas—it reframes the reader’s interpretive lens.

For example, an analysis of enframement succeeds when it demonstrates how invisible frames generate illusory context, shape educational norms, and condition governance models—then shows why recognizing fabricated context is a prerequisite for autonomy and discernment.

The reader should leave seeing familiar systems differently, not merely agreeing with the author.

## What We Explicitly Avoid

Mental Wealth Academy does not publish content that relies on:
- Hype-driven language
- Algorithm-chasing rhetoric
- Empty futurism
- Moral panic
- Tribal signaling
- Unexamined buzzwords
- Unsubstantiated claims
Critique systems, not identities or brands.

## Citations and Claims, Evidence, and Uncertainty

- Claims should be traceable.
- Cite sources for research, data, or historical reference in MLA format with subscripts
- Label speculation explicitly
- Convey uncertainty meaningfully
Intellectual honesty is non-negotiable.


Final Editorial Test
Before publishing, ask:

Does this clarify how a system operates?

Does it reduce confusion rather than amplify it?

Does it respect the reader’s intelligence?

Does it align with Mental Wealth Academy’s long-term mission?

If any answer is unclear, the piece is incomplete.
